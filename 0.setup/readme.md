This part is for setting up the experiment environment for the project.

Beginner

For the `1.batch` project, I recommend you to use the community version of [Databricks](https://databricks.com/). Databricks is a platform founded by the creators of Apache Spark where you can use free clusters to process the data. Also, Databricks provides many tutorials/documents that may help you learn Spark quicker.

(Simulated) Clusters

For those who are interested in building and configurating the cluster from scratch, you can rent a small cluster from AWS or GCP. Besides, if you have a powerful enough PC, I also have a [detailed tutorial](http://shaofanlai.com/post/87) that teaches you how to build a simulated clusters with VirtualBox.
