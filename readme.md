LA Crime Data Analysis
---------------------

This is a data science practice that focuses on the crime analysis in LA with Apache family (**Spark/Hadoop/HDFS/Yarn/Zookeeper/Kafka**).

I have been living in LA for over one year and I received some safety warnings from our Department of Public Safety from time to time. I feel necessary to know about how the crimes distributed in LA so that I don't have to worry that much when I am out for dinner.

All projects are produced by myself and feel welcome to comment in the issue section.
- 0. Setup
  - Set up the environments for the projects.
- 1. Batch Analysis
  - We are going to analyze the historical statistics of LA's crime history.
- 2. Streaming Analysis
  - We are going to build a simulated streaming source and design a streaming analysis pipeline on it.
