LA Crime data analysis
---------------------

This is a data science practice that focuses on the crime analysis in LA with Apache Spark. 

I have been living in LA for over one year and I received some safety warnings from our Department of Public Safety from time to time. I feel necessary to know about how the crimes distributed in LA so that I don't have to worry that much when I am out for dinner.

All projects are produced by myself and feel welcome to comment in the issue section.
